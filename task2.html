                <p>Real Madrid C. F. announces that, as planned, the club has agreed with Dani Carvajal to extend the player's contract, which will keep him at the club until 30 June 2026.</p>
                <p>Carvajal joined Real Madrid in 2002, when he was just 10 years old, and played in all categories of our youth system from Under-12s to Castilla in 2010. On 12 May 2004, he took centre stage in an iconic image of our club's history, laying the first stone of Real Madrid City alongside the then-honorary president, Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>
                 <p>Since 2013 he has been a member of the first team, and in his 12 seasons wearing our shirt, he has become a legend of Real Madrid and of world football.</p>
                 <p>With Real Madrid he has amassed 26 trophies in 427 games: Champions League (6), Club World Cup (5), Uefa Super Cup (5), LaLiga titles (4), Copa del Rey (2) and Spanish Super Cups (4). Carvajal is one of only five players to have won 6 European Cups. At Wembley, on 1 June, he was named Player of the Match of the Champions League final, when Real Madrid clinched their 15th European Cup.</p>

            <div class="c2">
                <p>Carvajal is also a legend in the Spanish national team, with which he has been capped 50 times. With Spain, he has won 1 European Championship, 1 Nations League, 1 European Under-21 Championship and 1 European Under-19 Championship.</p>
                <p>Real Madrid would like to express its support and affection for him and wishes him a speedy recovery so that we can enjoy his football on the pitch again as soon as possible.
